                For several years, I have traveled extensively throughout Mexico.  It is a country and land steeped in history, culture and beautiful imagery.  People often ask me if I'm "worried" while I'm there.  The simple answer is "no".  Mexico is no different than any other country, state or city.  Courtesy and understanding goes a long way.  One of the biggest problems I have is that being a tall blonde haired, blue-eyed "gringo"; I stand out like a sour thumb.  Add a camera into the equation and the factor doubles.  People in general look at you with distrust and great concern. This doesn't make for the easiest means of photography.
    On a recent trip to Mexico City with my family, I decided to take a different approach.  In a more Conceptual approach, a plan was formulated and the project began.  The images would be captured in a more "street/gorilla" fashion. My camera was concealed in a shoulder bag and images were taken using a remote control.  The images would not be manipulated post process and presented as such.  I did however; use different lenses and filters according to lighting or weather conditions.  What you see is what I got.  More than 200 images were captured but these are some of my favorites.
